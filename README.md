# Software Quality Checklist

The purpose of this repository is to provide a checklist for documenting the quality of software.
It is a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) document that is expected to be filled out and
included within a software release, to indicate the current state of software quality for the given release.

The checklist is version controlled using the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) convention and are stored in
directories following this convention.
For example, version 1.0.0 can be found at:

`checklist/v1.0.0/SOFTWARE_QUALITY.MD`

The software quality checklist is adapted from the document 
_Guidelines for Software Quality v1.1_ ([van Gompel et al., 2016](https://github.com/CLARIAH/software-quality-guidelines/blob/b842de9dbbe50f9d08c91105d8ac0c7b147c433f/softwareguidelines.pdf)),

The following changes were made:
1. The term "Perfect" was changed to "Exc" (as in, _Excellent_) because it seemed like a more appropriate descriptor.
2. A "Description" column was added so that one can, for example, provide extra information as to why one chose a rating for a given criterion.
3. The "ID" values were changed so that they are better suited for a stand-alone checklist document.
4. Some criteria were reworded for additional clarity and consistency.
5. Some criteria were added that are not present in the original checklist.
6. Material from the document was used to aid the reader in understanding the checklist.
