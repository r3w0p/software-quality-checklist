# Software Quality Checklist

The purpose of this repository is to provide a checklist for documenting the quality of software.
It is a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) document that is expected to be filled out and
included within a software release, to indicate the
current state of software quality for the given release.

The checklist is version controlled using the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) convention.
Version 1.0.0, for example, can be found at the following directory:

`checklist/v1.0.0/QUALITY_CHECKLIST.MD`

Versions of the checklist that are currently under development can be found at branches named:

`v<MAJOR>.<Minor>.<patch>`
