This document is a checklist that provides a software quality assessment.
Each criterion in the checklist is a question regarding a specific aspect of software quality.
Each question is answered with a single &check; for the rating that best reflects the quality of the criterion in the
software.
The ratings are as follows:

0. No quality (or not applicable)
1. Minimal quality
2. Adequate quality
3. Good quality
4. Excellent quality

A description may be provided for more information as to why a rating was chosen for a given criterion.
