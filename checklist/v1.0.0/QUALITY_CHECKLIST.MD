The software quality checklist in this document is adapted from the document 
_Guidelines for Software Quality v1.1_ ([van Gompel et al., 2016](https://github.com/CLARIAH/software-quality-guidelines/blob/b842de9dbbe50f9d08c91105d8ac0c7b147c433f/softwareguidelines.pdf)),

The following changes were made to their checklist:
1. The term "Perfect" was changed to "Exc" (as in, _Excellent_) because it seemed like a more appropriate descriptor.
2. A "Description" column was added so that one can, for example, provide extra information as to why one chose a rating for a given criterion.
3. The "ID" values were changed so that they are better suited for a stand-alone checklist document.
4. Some criteria were reworded for additional clarity and consistency.
5. Some criteria were added that are not present in the original checklist.

## 1. Checklist

Each criterion is a question regarding a specific aspect of software quality.
Each question is answered with a single &check; for the rating that best reflects the quality of the criterion in the software.

The ratings are as follows:

0. No quality (or not applicable)
1. Minimal quality
2. Adequate quality
3. Good quality
4. Excellent quality

A description can be provided for more information.

### Changes TODO
- Avoid open-source-centric concepts of quality e.g. "public".
- Use "software" instead of "project".
- Avoid "(if any)" because N/A is an option.
- Rewrite 1.14 Reusability
